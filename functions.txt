We all know the syntax of a regular Javascript function.

function myName(name) {
   return name;
};

What do we know about arrow functions.
1. We know arrow functions have a more concise and legible syntax, as opposed to a regular Javascript function.
2. The biggest difference is the scoping of "this" as it relates to arrow functions.
3. Arrow functions use the "this" keyword differently.
4. "this" does not get redefined in an arrow function. It gets defined in the same scope that you call the function in. 
As opposed to regular functions that redefines the "this" keyword.
5. The scope of this in an arrow function, is similar to how other programming languages work.
